# Api-master
This my first project regarding api's using node.js and mongodb with mongose.

To run the project :

Clone the project in your computer.

Move Inside the project folder and install Node.JS modules.

I have used mongocloud created cluster then made collections in that database such as books , authour , publications.

Use postman to manipulate the data that will create a backend for u.

Thus , its basically api backend based that runs in the server of ur browser as "localhost:3000".
